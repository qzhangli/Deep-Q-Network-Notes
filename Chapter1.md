## Chapter 1
Reinforcement Learning: the main idea is that the agent learn from the environment by interacting with it and receving rewards.
- Our Agent receives state S0 from the Environment — we receive the first frame of our game (environment).
- Based on that state S0, the agent takes an action A0 — our agent will move to the right.
- Environment transitions to a new state S1 — new frame.
- Environment gives some reward R1 to the agent — we’re not dead (Positive Reward +1).
